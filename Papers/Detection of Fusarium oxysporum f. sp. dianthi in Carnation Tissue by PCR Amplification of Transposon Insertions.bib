  abstract = "ABSTRACT Strains of the carnation wilt pathogen, Fusarium
              oxysporum f. sp. dianthi, can be distinguished by DNA fingerprint
              patterns, using the fungal transposable elements Fot1 and impala
              as probes for Southern hybridization. The DNA fingerprints
              correspond to three groups of F. oxysporum f. sp. dianthi
              strains: the first group includes isolates of races 1 and 8; the
              second group includes isolates of races 2, 5 and 6; and the third
              group includes isolates of race 4. Genomic DNAs flanking
              race-associated insertion sites of Fot1 (from races 1, 2, and 8)
              or impala (from race 4) were amplified by the inverse polymerase
              chain reaction (PCR) technique. These regions were cloned and
              sequenced, and three sets of primers overlapping the 3' or 5' end
              of the transposon and its genomic insertion were designed. Using
              fungal genomic DNA as template in PCR experiments, primer pairs
              generated amplification products of 295, 564 and 1,315 bp,
              corresponding to races 1 and 8; races 2, 5, and 6; and race 4,
              respectively. When multiplex PCR was performed with genomic DNA
              belonging to races 1 and 8, 2, or 4, single amplimers were
              generated, allowing clear race determination of the isolate
              tested. PCR was successfully performed on DNA extracted from
              susceptible carnation cv. Indios infected with isolates
              representative of races 1, 2, 4, and 8.",
