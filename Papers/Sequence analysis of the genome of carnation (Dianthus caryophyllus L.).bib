  abstract    = "The whole-genome sequence of carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus
                 L.) cv. 'Francesco' was determined using a combination of
                 different new-generation multiplex sequencing platforms. The
                 total length of the non-redundant sequences was 568,887,315
                 bp, consisting of 45,088 scaffolds, which covered 91\% of the
                 622 Mb carnation genome estimated by k-mer analysis. The N50
                 values of contigs and scaffolds were 16,644 bp and 60,737 bp,
                 respectively, and the longest scaffold was 1,287,144 bp. The
                 average GC content of the contig sequences was 36\%. A total
                 of 1050, 13, 92 and 143 genes for tRNAs, rRNAs, snoRNA and
                 miRNA, respectively, were identified in the assembled genomic
                 sequences. For protein-encoding genes, 43 266 complete and
                 partial gene structures excluding those in transposable
                 elements were deduced. Gene coverage was âˆ¼ 98\%, as deduced
                 from the coverage of the core eukaryotic genes. Intensive
                 characterization of the assigned carnation genes and
                 comparison with those of other plant species revealed
                 characteristic features of the carnation genome. The results
                 of this study will serve as a valuable resource for
                 fundamental and applied research of carnation, especially for
                 breeding new carnation varieties. Further information on the
                 genomic sequences is available at
