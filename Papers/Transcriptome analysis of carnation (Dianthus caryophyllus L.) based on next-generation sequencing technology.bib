  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.), in the
                 family Caryophyllaceae, can be found in a wide range of colors
                 and is a model system for studies of flower senescence. In
                 addition, it is one of the most important flowers in the
                 global floriculture industry. However, few genomics resources,
                 such as sequences and markers are available for carnation or
                 other members of the Caryophyllaceae. To increase our
                 understanding of the genetic control of important characters
                 in carnation, we generated an expressed sequence tag (EST)
                 database for a carnation cultivar important in horticulture by
                 high-throughput sequencing using 454 pyrosequencing
                 technology. RESULTS: We constructed a normalized cDNA library
                 and a 3'-UTR library of carnation, obtaining a total of
                 1,162,126 high-quality reads. These reads were assembled into
                 300,740 unigenes consisting of 37,844 contigs and 262,896
                 singlets. The contigs were searched against an Arabidopsis
                 sequence database, and 61.8\% (23,380) of them had at least
                 one BLASTX hit. These contigs were also annotated with Gene
                 Ontology (GO) and were found to cover a broad range of GO
                 categories. Furthermore, we identified 17,362 potential simple
                 sequence repeats (SSRs) in 14,291 of the unigenes. We focused
                 on gene discovery in the areas of flower color and ethylene
                 biosynthesis. Transcripts were identified for almost every
                 gene involved in flower chlorophyll and carotenoid metabolism
                 and in anthocyanin biosynthesis. Transcripts were also
                 identified for every step in the ethylene biosynthesis
                 pathway. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first large-scale
                 sequence data set for carnation, generated using
                 next-generation sequencing technology. The large EST database
                 generated from these sequences is an informative resource for
                 identifying genes involved in various biological processes in
                 carnation and provides an EST resource for understanding the
                 genetic diversity of this plant.",
