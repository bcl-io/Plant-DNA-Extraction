### [Cold Spring Harbor Protocols](http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2009/10/pdb.rec11984.full)

* Reagent	Amount to add (for 10 mL)	Final concentration
* Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) (10% in H2O)a	3 mL	3%
* 5 M NaCl	2.8 mL	28%
* 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)	0.4 mL	4%
* 1 M Tris-Cl (pH 8.0)	1 mL	10%
* Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (MW 40 kDa)	0.3 g	3%
* β-Mercaptoethanol	0.02 mL	0.2%
* H2O	2.48 mL	24.8%

Prepare CTAB extraction buffer immediately before use; buffer is only good when freshly prepared. Store 10% CTAB stock solution at 37°C to avoid precipitation. It may be stored at 37°C for several years.
